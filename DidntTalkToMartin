John is staring into the sunset.
You : What's wrong John?
John : Oh, i was just wondering....
You : About what?
John : Well, I was the youth pastor for this church for 5 years
John : And in those 5 years, I was unable to see the change in the youth's hearts...
John : I have failed as their pastor, and I can't do anything to fix it
John refuses to talk any more. Just staring off into the difference
