Martin : Calvin, can you stop? Im trying to play piano here. Go and play with some of the other kids.
Calvin : Martin, the new pastor wants to talk with you.
Martin : Didn't I tell you that outsiders are dead to me?
You should understand that we aren't the same as the people outside Calvin.
We of the church have evolved. We are superior than anyone else.  WE ARE BLAH BLAH BLAH
Calvin : I'm sorry about this. He likes to talk a lot....
2 HOURS LATER
Martin : And to further the point-
You    : Can you just listen to me?
Martin : Did you listen to anything I said? You aren't worthy to speak to beings like me. Anyway, I bet you couldn't even beat Calvin.
Martin : He should be stronger than the average child here, as he's been trained by me.
Calvin : Ummmm.... He actually did. By a long shot.
Martin : ........
Martin : ..............
Martin : .......................
Martin : Hmm.... well.... This is interesting. No one from the outside should be able to even match the weakest of us.
You    : I actually don't know! I was powerless a couple of days ago.....
Martin : It seem's that you have grown stronger from something in this church.
Martin : Something is making you stronger, and if it becomes a threat to us, then it is dangerous.
Martin : I think that I should eliminate you as soon as possible, before you grow too strong.
Martin : CALVIN! Its combination time! Lets pound this guy to pieces.
