First day on the new job. You had applied to be the new youth pastor of a church called WMCC.
The job description said that the job would come with a couple of problems involving the children
But sometimes that is the job of a youth pastor, so I regarded it as normal.
After driving to the church where I was greeted at the front by my employer.
A man named Richard.
Richard: Ah, hello, you must be the new pastor!
Richard: Come in, we have been expecting you.
Richard: I'm so happy to see you,
As you may know, there are a couple of problems in our church.
You: Yes, I was informed when I applied for the job, but I was never really told what those problems were.
You: What exactly is so wrong with the children here?
Richard : um, well, our children went through a bit of a change...
You : A Change?
Richard : Yes. A while ago, the children and youth started to gain some interesting skills...
You : Like superpowers? That's crazy!
Richard : Well, not as drastic as superpowers, but for sure, they many times stronger than the normal person.
You : Wait, whats the problem then? I don't see the kids taking over the world or anything...
Richard : Well.... They have kind of broken off from our church. They reject anyone who tries to come near to them. Even their family.
You : And why was I chosen for this? Im just a regular guy... There's no way I can match up to these kids....
Richard: No, don't be worried. I'm sure that you'll do fine.
Richard: But just to be sure, I will give you these
RECIEVED 5 POTIONS
RECIEVED A PAIR OF CHOPSTICKS
You: Umm... Why is this necessary? And why the pair of- oh, where did Richard go?
