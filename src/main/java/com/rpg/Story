Some people have special weapons or materials that they can drop when you beat them.
They can be quite useful, so it's useful to try and get the items each person will give you.
By the way, if you happen to get more than one of a weapon, I will take them from you in exchange for money.
I mean, you won't need them anyway.
How am I supposed to get them? Well, thats a secret. Hehehehe
