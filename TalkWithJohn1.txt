John : Well, you need some help huh?
You : Yeah, I don't really know where to start.
John : Well, you should probably start smaller. Have you tried talking with Martin?
You : Oh, that guy? Yeah, but he wouldn't talk to me. Why? Is he something special?
John : Yeah, he is actually one of the big 8, but the weakest one.
John : He considers all other people outside the church as inferior, so it might be a bit difficult to actually talk with him.
You : Then what do I do? I have to defeat him at some point...
John : Well, Martin actually has a little brother. Try defeating him first. Maybe then he will consider talking to you.
You: Ok, thanks, Ill try that out.
John : No problem.
