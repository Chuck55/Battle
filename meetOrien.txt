After Richard mysteriously vanishes, you take a good look around the entrance of the church.
It seems like a very nice place
There were stairs that looked like they led upstairs to another part of the church,
The floor was clean, the yelling of young children echoed from farther down the stairs.
Suddenly, a young man with wack hair and weird eyes comes running from out of the kitchen
Mysterious Young man : Hey, you must be the new pastor, nice to meet you.
You : "Yeah, that's me, whats your name?"
Mysterious Young Man : I'm Orien, i'm one of the older kids at this church. Richard tasked me with the job to answer any questions that you may have about the job
You : Well, i'm pretty caught up except for one thing. What did Richard mean by the youth kids being a little... rowdy?
Orien : Oh, well......... Let's just say that things have changed since Jeff, our old youth pastor left. Everyone has become a lot more hostile to outsiders
You : Oh... Do you have any tips to help me survive? I really want to help this church!
Orien : Well, the main thing that you do is to beat the big 7.
You : The big 7? It this some type of video game or something?
Orien : No, the big 7 are the 8 oldest kids in our church, who have the most influence. If you manage convince them to be on your side, then you should be alright!
You : Ok, got it. Beat the big 7, wait, 8 kids?
Orien : Yeah, we don't know how to count.
You : Ok, and how do I convince them? Talk it over in a quiet room?
Orien: Na, you beat the Sh#t out of them.
You : Wait what!??
Orien : What, you don't know how? Ok, I'll teach you, get ready!
